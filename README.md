Algorithms implemented to solve different challenges 

The problems are from various test platform in order to help developers to improve their skills. The programming languadge used is C++.
As IDE I use Visual Studio Code or the Qt Creator. If you don't have yet a favorit IDE you can try both.

A little bit about the solutions provided: 
  1. The solutios presented satisfy all the requirements requested by the challange / test.
  2. The solution are free.
  3. This is a work in progress repository and is a 100% volunteer effort.
  4. I'll keep adding more content periodically.
  5. Any kind of feedback is welcomed.
  6. You can clone / download and use any file. The only request that I have is to keep the solution free.
  
Enjoy !
